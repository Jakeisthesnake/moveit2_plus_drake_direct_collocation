### Project Journal
4/1
* Finished pick place tutorial -had to bump up max distance for connect stage to accept solution
* Starting to figure out Drake's implementation of TOPPRA
* Read about the Ruckig library - it looks like it should support torque limits, but I can't find any documentation the clearly states that is does. Anyways, TOPPRA will be a useful addition to Moveit if for no other reason than to give an example interface for Drake.
